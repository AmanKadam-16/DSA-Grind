# if else statements in Python

# Example 1 | Even / Odd
num = 33
if num % 2 == 0:
    print(f'{num} is a Even number.')
else:
    print(f'{num} is an Odd number.')


# Example 2 | Problem Statement
# ðŸŽ¯ Requirements:
# If the age is less than 5, the entry is free.

# If the age is between 5 and 12 (inclusive), the ticket price is â‚¹100.

# If the age is between 13 and 59 (inclusive), the ticket price is â‚¹200.

# If the age is 60 or above, the ticket price is â‚¹120.
age = 4
# Solution :
if age < 5:
    print('Entry is free.')
