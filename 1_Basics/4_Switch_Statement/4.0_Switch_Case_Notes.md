## Python Switch Case Statements (Using `match-case`)  

In many programming languages like C++ or Java, **switch-case statements** provide a clean way to handle multiple conditional branches.  
Python didn't have this feature until version **3.10**, where the **`match-case`** statement was introduced.

---

## üîç What is `match-case`?

The `match-case` statement in Python is similar to the switch-case statement found in other languages. It allows you to match a value (or even patterns) and run corresponding code blocks.

> ‚úÖ **Note:** `match-case` requires **Python 3.10 or above**.

---

## ‚úÖ Basic Syntax

```python
match variable:
    case value1:
        # code block 1
    case value2:
        # code block 2
    case _:
        # default block (like 'else')
```

- `match` is like `switch`
- `case` is like `case` in C++/Java
- `_` is the wildcard case (similar to `default`)

---

## üß† Example: Simple Menu System

```python
choice = 2

match choice:
    case 1:
        print("Start Game")
    case 2:
        print("Load Game")
    case 3:
        print("Exit")
    case _:
        print("Invalid Choice")
```

**‚úÖ Output:**
```
Load Game
```

## üîÅ Flowchart of `match-case`

```text
         +-------------------+
         |   match value     |
         +---------+---------+
                   |
     +-------------+-------------+
     |             |             |
+----v----+   +----v----+   +----v----+
| case 1  |   | case 2  |   | case _  |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+
| Block 1 |   | Block 2 |   | Default |
+---------+   +---------+   +---------+
```

## üîó Example with Strings

```python
language = "Python"

match language:
    case "C++":
        print("You chose C++")
    case "Python":
        print("You chose Python")
    case "Java":
        print("You chose Java")
    case _:
        print("Language not recognized")
```

---

## ‚ö° Advanced Example: Matching Patterns

```python
point = (0, 1)

match point:
    case (0, 0):
        print("Origin")
    case (0, y):
        print(f"Y-axis at {y}")
    case (x, 0):
        print(f"X-axis at {x}")
    case (x, y):
        print(f"Point at ({x}, {y})")
```

**‚úÖ Output:**
```
Y-axis at 1
```

This is **pattern matching** ‚Äî a powerful upgrade over basic switch-case logic in other languages.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- `match-case` is only available from **Python 3.10** onwards
- The underscore `_` is used as a **default** or fallback case
- You can use **patterns** instead of just values (like tuples, classes, etc.)
- Each `case` does **not fall through** ‚Äî only one block runs

## üìå Summary Table

| Concept | Python Keyword |
|---------|----------------|
| Switch | `match` |
| Case | `case` |
| Default | `_` |
| Fall-through | ‚ùå Not allowed |
| Pattern Matching | ‚úÖ Yes |

## üí° Additional Examples

### Multiple Values in One Case

```python
day = "Saturday"

match day:
    case "Monday" | "Tuesday" | "Wednesday" | "Thursday" | "Friday":
        print("Weekday")
    case "Saturday" | "Sunday":
        print("Weekend")
    case _:
        print("Not a valid day")
```

### Matching with Conditions (Guards)

```python
x = 10

match x:
    case n if n < 0:
        print("Negative number")
    case n if n == 0:
        print("Zero")
    case n if n > 0:
        print("Positive number")
```

### Class Pattern Matching

```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y

point = Point(1, 2)

match point:
    case Point(x=0, y=0):
        print("Origin point")
    case Point(x=0, y=y):
        print(f"Point on Y-axis: {y}")
    case Point(x=x, y=0):
        print(f"Point on X-axis: {x}")
    case Point(x=x, y=y):
        print(f"Point at ({x}, {y})")
```

**üí° Pro Tip:** Use `match-case` for cleaner branching logic, especially when checking against multiple possible values or structured data like tuples and classes.
