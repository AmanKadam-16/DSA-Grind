## Python Basic Input/Output

If you're just beginning your programming journey with Python, it’s perfectly fine not to dive too deep into its advanced features right away. The key is to first build a solid understanding of the basics, especially input and output operations. In this guide, we’ll explore how Python handles basic input and output, which are fundamental to interacting with your program.

## Printing Output

In Python, displaying output is incredibly simple using the `print()` function. You can pass any message or variable to `print()`, and it will be shown on the console.

### Example:

```python
print("Hey, Striver!")
```

**Output:**

```
Hey, Striver!
```

You can also print multiple lines by calling `print()` more than once or by using newline characters `\n`.

### Example:

```python
print("Hey, Striver!")
print("Hey, Striver!")
```

**Output:**

```
Hey, Striver!
Hey, Striver!
```

Or using `\n`:

```python
print("Hey, Striver!\nHey, Striver!")
```

**Output:**

```
Hey, Striver!
Hey, Striver!
```

Unlike C++, you don't need to use `std::` or worry about flushing output manually.

## Taking Input

Python takes user input using the `input()` function. It always returns the input as a string, so if you need another type (like integer or float), you'll need to convert it explicitly.

### Example:

```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello,", name)
```

**Sample Input:**

```
Enter your name: Aman
```

**Output:**

```
Hello, Aman
```

## Converting Input to Integer

If you're taking numerical input, you’ll usually want to convert the string to an integer or float using `int()` or `float()`.

### Example:

```python
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print("You are", age, "years old.")
```

**Sample Input:**

```
Enter your age: 21
```

**Output:**

```
You are 21 years old.
```

## Multiple Inputs in One Line

Python allows taking multiple inputs in one line using the `split()` function.

### Example:

```python
a, b = input("Enter two numbers: ").split()
print("First number:", a)
print("Second number:", b)
```

**Sample Input:**

```
Enter two numbers: 5 10
```

**Output:**

```
First number: 5
Second number: 10
```

If needed, convert them to integers:

```python
a, b = map(int, input("Enter two numbers: ").split())
print("Sum:", a + b)
```

## Summary

* Use `print()` for output
* Use `input()` for input (returns a string)
* Use `int()`, `float()` for conversion
* Use `split()` to take multiple inputs in one line
